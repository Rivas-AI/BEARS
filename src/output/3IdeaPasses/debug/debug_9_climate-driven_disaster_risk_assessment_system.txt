Okay, let's tackle this. The project is a Climate-Driven Disaster Risk Assessment System. It uses ML to analyze historical data, weather, and geography to predict vulnerable zones. 

First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project itself is about assessing risk, not directly reducing emissions. It might help in planning to avoid areas where disasters could be worse, but that's indirect. So maybe a low score here, like 0.2. Not sure if it leads to emission cuts directly.

Policy_APPLICABILITY. High, because governments and policymakers need data on disaster risks to create effective policies. Accurate predictions would guide where to allocate resources, maybe influence zoning laws or infrastructure planning. So probably a high score, maybe 0.9.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT. If it helps communities prepare for disasters, that's a big benefit. Early warnings, better resource allocation, reducing casualties and damage. So this should be high, maybe 0.9 as well. 

Wait, but the system combines decision trees and neural networks. How accurate is it? If it's reliable, then the social benefit is higher. Also, if it's accessible to local communities, that adds to the benefit. So maybe 0.9 is justified. 

Putting it all together. Emissions reduction is low because the system doesn't cut emissions directly. Policy applicability and social benefit are high because the system supports proactive measures and disaster preparedness. The summary should explain that while it doesn't reduce emissions directly, it helps in policy and community resilience.

IDEA_ID: 9_climate-driven_disaster_risk_assessment_system  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.2  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.9  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: This project primarily enhances disaster preparedness and risk mitigation rather than directly reducing emissions, hence a low EMISSIONS_REDUCTION score. However, its ability to inform targeted policy decisions (e.g., infrastructure planning, resource allocation) and improve community resilience through accurate vulnerability predictions justifies high scores for POLICY_APPLICABILITY and SOCIAL_BENEFIT.
