Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to estimate the impact of the Climate-Resilient Agriculture Supply Chain Optimization System on three metrics: EMISSIONS_REDUCTION, POLICY_APPLICABILITY, and SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Each needs a score between 0.0 and 1.0, and then a summary.

First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project uses deep learning to optimize supply chains, which can reduce emissions by making transportation more efficient. If the model can predict demand and supply fluctuations, that might prevent overproduction, which in turn reduces waste. Overproduction and waste contribute to emissions because of the energy used in production and the methane from decomposing waste. So optimizing logistics and reducing waste would lower emissions. But how much? It's probably not going to eliminate all emissions, but it's a significant area. Maybe around 0.7? Maybe a bit higher if it's really effective. Let's go with 0.75.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. The system uses graph theory to predict demand and supply, which could help policymakers make informed decisions about resource allocation and climate adaptation strategies. If the model provides data-driven insights, that's valuable for creating policies. For example, knowing where supply chain disruptions might occur could lead to better infrastructure planning or subsidies. However, the direct applicability might depend on how well the results are communicated and integrated into policy frameworks. I think it's a good fit, so maybe 0.8. It's useful but might not be a silver bullet.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Optimizing supply chains can lead to more stable food supplies, which is a big social benefit. Reducing waste means more food is available, which can lower costs and improve food security. This is especially important in regions vulnerable to climate change. Also, efficient logistics might create jobs or support local economies. However, the social benefits might be more indirect and depend on implementation. Still, it's a solid positive. Maybe 0.8 as well. 

Putting it all together, the summary should explain that the project reduces emissions through efficient logistics and waste reduction, supports policy with data-driven insights, and enhances food security and economic stability, leading to high social benefits. The scores are 0.75, 0.8, 0.8. The reasoning is that while the project has clear benefits, there are limitations in how much it can directly influence emissions or policy without broader systemic changes. But the potential is high, hence the scores above 0.7.

IDEA_ID: 16_climate-resilient_agriculture_supply_chain_optimiz  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.75  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.8  
SUMMARY: This project addresses emissions by optimizing supply chains to reduce transportation waste and overproduction, achieving moderate to high impact. Its data-driven insights on demand/supply fluctuations make it highly applicable for climate adaptation policies. Social benefits include improved food security, reduced waste, and economic resilience, especially for vulnerable communities facing climate disruptions.
