Okay, let's tackle this. The project is an AI early warning system for climate disasters like floods, landslides, and heatwaves. First, I need to assess EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The main goal here isn't directly reducing emissions but preventing disasters. However, if the system helps avoid damage to infrastructure, maybe that reduces the need for reconstruction, which does emit CO2. But that's indirect. So maybe a low score here, maybe 0.2.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. Early warning systems can inform policy by providing data for risk assessments and emergency planning. Governments might use this AI to make better-informed policies about disaster preparedness and resource allocation. So this could be higher, maybe 0.7.

For SOCIAL_BENEFIT, saving lives and reducing injuries is a major benefit. Communities get warnings to evacuate or prepare, which directly helps vulnerable populations. That's a high impact, so maybe 0.9. 

Summary: The system's primary benefit is social by preventing disasters' human toll. Policy use is moderate because it supports data-driven decisions. Emissions reduction is minimal since it's not directly cutting emissions but rather mitigating damage.

IDEA_ID: 6_artificial_intelligence_for_early_warning_systems  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.2  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.7  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: The project's primary impact is indirect emissions reduction through disaster mitigation (e.g., preventing infrastructure damage). It has strong policy applicability by enabling data-driven disaster preparedness and resource allocation. Social benefits are high due to life-saving early warnings for vulnerable communities.
