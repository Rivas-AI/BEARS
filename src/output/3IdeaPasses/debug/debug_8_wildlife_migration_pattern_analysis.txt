Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to estimate the impact of the Wildlife Migration Pattern Analysis project on three metrics: Emissions Reduction, Policy Applicability, and Social Benefit. 

First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project is about analyzing migration patterns using sensors and ML. I don't see a direct link to reducing emissions. Maybe it helps in conservation, which could prevent habitat loss, but that's a stretch. So probably low here, maybe around 0.2.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. If the model identifies key habitats and species, that data could inform conservation policies. Governments and organizations might use it to create protected areas or adjust land-use policies. That seems more impactful. Maybe a 0.7 or 0.8.

For SOCIAL_BENEFIT, protecting wildlife can have indirect benefits like preserving ecosystems that provide clean water and air. Also, it might support ecotourism and indigenous communities. But the direct social benefit isn't huge. Maybe 0.6.

Wait, but the project's description mentions clustering to identify key species and habitats. That data is crucial for policy, so maybe Policy Applicability is higher. Social Benefit could be moderate because ecosystems support human populations. Let me adjust: Emissions 0.2, Policy 0.8, Social 0.6. Summary would explain that while it doesn't cut emissions directly, it supports policies and ecosystem services, which have social benefits.

IDEA_ID: 8_wildlife_migration_pattern_analysis  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.2  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.6  
SUMMARY: The project indirectly supports emissions reduction by enabling conservation of ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, though its primary focus is not on reducing emissions directly. It strongly informs climate policy through data-driven habitat and species protection, aiding in sustainable land-use decisions. Social benefits arise from preserving biodiversity, which sustains ecosystem services critical for human well-being, though direct societal impacts are secondary to ecological outcomes.
