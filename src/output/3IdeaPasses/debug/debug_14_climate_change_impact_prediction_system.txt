Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking for an impact estimation of a deep learning project called the Climate Change Impact Prediction System. The three metrics to evaluate are EMISSIONS_REDUCTION, POLICY_APPLICABILITY, and SOCIAL_BENEFIT.

First, I need to understand what each metric means. EMISSIONS_REDUCTION refers to how much the project can lower greenhouse gases. The project here is a prediction system using CNNs for spatial analysis. Wait, the system itself doesn't reduce emissions directly. It's a tool for predicting impacts. So maybe EMISSIONS_REDUCTION is low because it's not an emission control tech. But it might help in planning mitigation strategies indirectly. Hmm, but the scale is 0.0 to 1.0. Let me think. If the system leads to better planning, maybe that could result in emissions reduction. But since the system is just a predictive tool, the direct impact on emissions is minimal. So maybe 0.3 or something.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. How useful is the project for policy decisions? If the system provides accurate predictions on sea-level rise and droughts, policymakers can use this data to create better regulations, allocate resources, etc. Since the project uses historical and geographical data, it's likely to be highly applicable. Policies need reliable data, so this system would be a strong tool for them. Maybe 0.8 or 0.9.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT is about how the project helps society. If it can predict climate impacts, communities can prepare for disasters, reduce damage, maybe save lives. It can help vulnerable populations by allowing early responses. So the social benefit would be high. Maybe 0.85.

Wait, but the system's accuracy is crucial. If the predictions are not reliable, the benefits might be lower. However, the prompt says it uses CNNs for spatial patterns, which are effective for image data. Assuming the model is accurate, the benefits would be significant. 

Putting it all together: EMISSIONS_REDUCTION is low because it's a prediction tool, not an emission reducer. POLICY_APPLICABILITY is high because the data is actionable for policies. SOCIAL_BENEFIT is high due to preparedness and mitigation of impacts. So the values might be EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.3, POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.9, SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.85. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any indirect emissions reduction. For example, if the system helps in optimizing resource use in agriculture to prevent droughts, maybe that could reduce emissions. But the project's description doesn't specify that. It's focused on predicting impacts, not on mitigation. So sticking with 0.3 for emissions. The summary should explain that the system's main impact is through enabling proactive measures and informing policy, leading to high policy applicability and social benefits but limited direct emissions reduction.

IDEA_ID: 14_climate_change_impact_prediction_system  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.3  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.9  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.85  
SUMMARY: The system directly predicts climate impacts rather than reducing emissions, hence a moderate EMISSIONS_REDUCTION score. However, its high POLICY_APPLICABILITY stems from providing actionable, data-driven insights for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. SOCIAL_BENEFIT is strong due to enabling proactive community preparedness for disasters like droughts and sea-level rise, though indirect impacts depend on policy implementation.
