Okay, let's tackle this. The project is about using deep learning to monitor and predict coastal erosion. First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project itself is a monitoring tool, so it doesn't directly reduce emissions. Maybe it helps in planning to avoid further erosion, but that's indirect. So maybe low, like 0.2.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. Coastal erosion is a big issue, and having real-time data and predictions can help policymakers make informed decisions about coastal management, zoning, and disaster preparedness. So that's probably medium to high. Maybe 0.7 or 0.8.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Coastal communities are at risk from erosion, so predicting events can help protect homes and infrastructure, reduce displacement, and save lives. Real-time alerts would be beneficial. So maybe around 0.8. 

Wait, but the model uses CNN and RNN. How accurate is it? If it's reliable, the benefits are higher. Also, the real-time aspect adds value. For emissions, maybe if the predictions lead to better land use planning that reduces the need for high-emission construction materials in vulnerable areas? That's a stretch, but possible. So maybe EMISSIONS_REDUCTION could be 0.3 instead of 0.2. 

Policy applicability is high because governments and local authorities need data-driven tools for climate adaptation. The project's ability to provide time series data and predictions would be very useful for creating policies. So 0.8. Social benefit is high because it directly protects communities and helps in early warning, so 0.8. 

Summary: The project doesn't directly cut emissions but supports adaptive measures that might reduce future emissions from coastal developments. It's very useful for policy decisions on coastal management and offers significant social benefits by protecting communities and enabling proactive measures.

SUMMARY: The project indirectly reduces emissions by enabling proactive coastal management, minimizing the need for high-emission infrastructure repairs and relocations. Its real-time erosion predictions and data-driven insights make it highly applicable for climate policy, aiding in zoning, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation. Social benefits are significant, as early warnings protect vulnerable communities, reduce displacement risks, and safeguard livelihoods in coastal regions.
