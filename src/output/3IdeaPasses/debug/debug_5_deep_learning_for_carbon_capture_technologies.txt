Okay, let's tackle this. The project is using deep learning, specifically CNN and RNN, to optimize carbon capture technologies. The goal is to analyze efficiency in real-time, considering factors like temperature, humidity, and pressure.

First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. Carbon capture is crucial for reducing greenhouse gases. If the ML model can optimize existing methods, making them more efficient, that should lead to lower emissions. But how effective is the model? If it significantly improves the capture rate, maybe 0.7 or higher. However, if the tech is already being used, the incremental gain might not be massive. Maybe 0.75?

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. Policies often rely on data and proven technologies. If this project provides real-time optimization, it could inform better regulations or incentives for industries. But policy applicability depends on adoption. If the model is accessible and proven, maybe 0.7. If it's a niche solution, lower. Let's say 0.7.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Better carbon capture means cleaner air and mitigating climate change impacts. However, the direct social benefits might be indirect. If the tech helps industries reduce emissions, it could prevent health issues from pollution. But the benefit might not be as immediate as, say, renewable energy. Maybe 0.65. Wait, maybe higher if it leads to broader adoption. Let me think. The project's success could lead to scalable solutions, which would have significant social benefits. So maybe 0.75? But I need to balance. The social benefit is tied to the effectiveness of the tech. So maybe 0.7.

Wait, the summary needs to explain the reasoning. So, for emissions, high potential because optimizing existing tech. Policy applicability is good if the model is adopted. Social benefit is through reduced emissions and better tech. Maybe the scores are 0.75, 0.7, 0.7. Let me check again. If the model is real-time, that's a plus for both emissions and policy. Social benefit is a bit more indirect, so maybe 0.7. Hmm. I'll go with that.

IDEA_ID: 5_deep_learning_for_carbon_capture_technologies  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.75  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.7  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.7  
SUMMARY: The project has strong potential to reduce emissions by optimizing carbon capture efficiency in real-time, directly enhancing existing technologies. Its applicability to policy decisions depends on adoption by industry and regulators, which could inform better climate strategies. Social benefits arise indirectly through improved air quality and climate mitigation, though broader societal impact hinges on scalability and integration into large-scale carbon capture systems.
