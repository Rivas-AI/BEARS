Okay, let's break this down. The project is about an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Monitoring System using ML. First, I need to assess EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. OTEC itself is a renewable energy source, so if the system helps optimize its efficiency, that would reduce reliance on fossil fuels. But how much? Maybe around 0.7 because it's a monitoring tool, not the energy source itself. Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. If governments or organizations can use this data to make better decisions on adopting OTEC, that's useful for policy. Maybe 0.6. Lastly, SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Access to clean energy can help communities, especially in coastal areas. But OTEC is still emerging, so maybe 0.5. Need to check if the monitoring makes OTEC more viable, which would increase social benefit. Maybe adjust to 0.6. Summary would tie these together.

Idea_ID: 17_ocean_thermal_energy_conversion_monitoring_system  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.7  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.6  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.6  
SUMMARY: The project enhances OTEC system efficiency through ML, directly reducing emissions by optimizing renewable energy generation. It supports policy decisions by providing actionable data for renewable energy adoption but may face adoption barriers. Social benefits include cleaner energy access, particularly for coastal communities, though OTECâ€™s scalability and cost remain challenges.
