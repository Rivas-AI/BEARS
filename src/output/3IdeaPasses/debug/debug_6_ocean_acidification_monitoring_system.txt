Okay, let's tackle this. The project is about monitoring ocean acidification using a deep learning system that processes time series data from various sources. The user wants me to estimate the impact on three metrics: emissions reduction, policy applicability, and social benefit.

First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project itself is a monitoring system, not directly reducing emissions. It might help in understanding the problem better, which could lead to actions that reduce emissions, but the direct impact is low. So maybe a low score here, like 0.2.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. If the system provides accurate data on acidification trends, policymakers can use that data to make informed decisions. For example, setting regulations on carbon emissions or protecting marine areas. The data would be useful, so probably a medium to high score. Maybe 0.7 or 0.8.

Then, SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Ocean acidification affects marine life, which in turn impacts fisheries and communities that rely on them. By monitoring this, the project could help prevent economic losses and protect livelihoods. So the social benefit is significant, maybe around 0.8 or 0.9.

Putting it all together: EMISSIONS_REDUCTION is low because it's not a direct solution. POLICY_APPLICABILITY is high due to data utility for regulations. SOCIAL_BENEFIT is high because protecting marine ecosystems benefits communities and economies.

IDEA_ID: 6_ocean_acidification_monitoring_system  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.2  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: The project directly monitors ocean acidification but does not reduce emissions itself, explaining the low EMISSIONS_REDUCTION score. Its high POLICY_APPLICABILITY stems from providing critical data for informed climate and environmental policies. SOCIAL_BENEFIT is high because the system safeguards marine ecosystems, which are vital for food security, biodiversity, and coastal communities' livelihoods.
