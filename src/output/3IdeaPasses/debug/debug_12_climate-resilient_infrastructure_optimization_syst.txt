Okay, let's tackle this impact estimation for the Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Optimization System project. First, I need to break down each metric.

Starting with EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project uses deep learning to optimize infrastructure, which probably leads to more efficient designs. Efficient infrastructure might use fewer materials or better materials, which reduces emissions during construction and operation. Also, maintenance cost predictions could prevent unnecessary repairs that might generate waste. But how significant is this? Maybe 0.7 because it's a medium to high impact but not the most direct emissions reduction like renewable energy projects.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. The system analyzes weather, geography, and materials, which are all relevant for urban planning and infrastructure policies. If governments or municipalities use this tool, it can inform better building codes and climate adaptation strategies. However, policy applicability might depend on how easy it is to integrate into existing frameworks. Maybe a 0.8 here because it's quite applicable but might face some adoption barriers.

For SOCIAL_BENEFIT, resilient infrastructure protects communities from climate impacts like extreme weather. This reduces damage to homes and public services, which in turn protects people's safety and livelihoods. Also, optimized maintenance could lead to cost savings that can be redirected to other social services. So maybe a 0.9 here, as it directly benefits communities by enhancing safety and reducing costs.

Putting it all together: Emissions reduction is moderate, policy applicability is high, and social benefit is very high. Need to check if the reasoning makes sense and the scores are justified. Let me adjust slightly if needed. Final scores: Emissions 0.7, Policy 0.8, Social 0.9.

IDEA_ID: 12_climate-resilient_infrastructure_optimization_syst  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.7  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: The project has strong potential to reduce emissions by optimizing infrastructure design and material use, minimizing waste and energy inefficiency. Its integration of climate data into policy frameworks enhances decision-making for resilient urban planning. The social benefit is high due to reduced climate-related infrastructure failures, safeguarding communities and lowering long-term maintenance costs.
