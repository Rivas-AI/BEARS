Okay, let's tackle this project impact estimation. The project is about an AI-powered network for monitoring ocean acidification. First, I need to assess EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project itself is about monitoring, not directly reducing emissions. So maybe it's a low score here, like 0.2. It might help in the long run by providing data for policies, but not directly cutting emissions.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. Since ocean acidification is a major climate issue, accurate data from this network would be very useful for policymakers. They can use the predictions to create regulations or protect marine ecosystems. So maybe a high score here, like 0.8.

For SOCIAL_BENEFIT, the project's data could help communities that rely on marine life, like fishing industries. By predicting changes, it might help in adapting strategies, preventing economic losses, and preserving biodiversity. That's beneficial, so maybe 0.7. Not the highest because it's indirect, but still significant.

In the summary, I should explain that while the project doesn't reduce emissions directly, it's valuable for policy and societal benefits. The monitoring helps in making informed decisions and protecting communities and ecosystems.

IDEA_ID: 4_ocean_acidification_monitoring_network  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.2  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.7  
SUMMARY: The project indirectly supports emissions reduction by enabling data-driven climate adaptation strategies, but its primary impact lies in informing policy and protecting marine ecosystems. Its high policy applicability stems from providing critical insights for ocean governance and conservation. Social benefits arise from safeguarding fisheries, coastal communities, and biodiversity, though direct emission reductions are limited due to the project's monitoring focus.
