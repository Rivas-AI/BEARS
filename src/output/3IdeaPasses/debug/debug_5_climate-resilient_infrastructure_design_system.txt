Okay, let's tackle this. The project is about a deep learning system using GANs to design climate-resilient infrastructure. First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. How does this directly reduce emissions? Well, optimized building designs could lead to more energy-efficient structures, maybe lower material use, which cuts down on emissions from construction and operation. But the main focus here is resilience, not necessarily emissions. So maybe moderate impact here.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. If the system can generate designs that meet future climate scenarios, governments and urban planners might use it to create better policies. It could inform building codes and infrastructure standards, making this pretty useful for policy decisions. So a higher score here.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Climate-resilient infrastructure protects communities from extreme weather, reduces displacement, and ensures safer living conditions. That's a significant benefit. Plus, efficient designs might lower costs, making it accessible for more communities. So high social benefit.

Putting it all together. Emissions reduction might be around 0.6 because while there's potential, it's not the primary goal. Policy applicability could be 0.8 because it's directly useful for planning and regulations. Social benefit is probably 0.9 due to the direct protection and safety for communities.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: The project has moderate emissions reduction potential by optimizing building designs for energy efficiency and material use, though its primary focus is resilience rather than direct emission cuts. It strongly supports policy decisions by enabling data-driven infrastructure planning aligned with future climate scenarios. Its high social benefit stems from reducing climate-related risks to communities, enhancing safety, and lowering long-term disaster recovery costs.
