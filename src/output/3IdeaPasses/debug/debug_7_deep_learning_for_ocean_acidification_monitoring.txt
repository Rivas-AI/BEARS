Okay, let's tackle this. The project is about using deep learning to monitor ocean acidification. First, for EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The project itself doesn't directly reduce emissions; it's a monitoring tool. So maybe a low score here, like 0.2. But wait, maybe if it helps in early detection, leading to actions that reduce emissions? Hmm, but that's indirect. So probably 0.2-0.3.

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. If the project provides real-time data and alerts, that's useful for policymakers. They can make informed decisions based on accurate monitoring. Maybe 0.7 or 0.8. It depends on how actionable the data is. Since it combines satellite and water samples, the data is reliable, so higher applicability. Let's say 0.8.

SOCIAL_BENEFIT. Ocean acidification affects marine life, which is crucial for fisheries and coastal communities. Early warnings could help communities adapt, protect livelihoods, and prevent ecosystem collapse. That's significant, so maybe 0.7 to 0.9. Considering the broader societal impact, 0.8 seems reasonable.

Summary: The project's main impact is in monitoring and providing data, which supports policy and social benefits but doesn't directly cut emissions. Hence, lower emissions score, higher policy and social scores.

IDEA_ID: 7_deep_learning_for_ocean_acidification_monitoring  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.3  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.8  
SUMMARY: The project directly addresses ocean acidification monitoring, which does not reduce emissions itself but enables early intervention to mitigate ecological damage. Its high-resolution data and real-time alerts make it highly actionable for policymakers targeting climate resilience. Social benefits are strong due to protecting marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities reliant on ocean health.
