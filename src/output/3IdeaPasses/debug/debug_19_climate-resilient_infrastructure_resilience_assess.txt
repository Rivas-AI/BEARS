Okay, let's tackle this. The project is about an AI tool that assesses infrastructure resilience using historical weather, future climate scenarios, and material properties. First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The tool itself doesn't directly reduce emissions, right? It helps in designing better infrastructure which might prevent damage and thus avoid the emissions from rebuilding. But how significant is that? Maybe moderate. So maybe 0.6?

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. If the tool provides data on infrastructure resilience, policymakers can use it to set standards or prioritize funding. That seems pretty useful, so maybe 0.8. They can make informed decisions based on the AI's analysis.

For SOCIAL_BENEFIT, resilient infrastructure protects communities from climate impacts like floods or extreme weather. This reduces displacement, economic losses, and saves lives. That's a big benefit, so maybe 0.9. The summary should tie these together, explaining that while direct emissions are low, the tool supports better planning and policy, leading to significant societal benefits.

EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.4  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.8  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: This project indirectly reduces emissions by optimizing infrastructure resilience, minimizing the need for resource-intensive repairs and replacements. Its high policy applicability stems from providing data-driven insights for climate-adaptive urban planning and regulatory frameworks. The social benefit is significant, as it safeguards vulnerable communities from climate-related infrastructure failures, enhancing safety and economic stability.
