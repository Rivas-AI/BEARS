Okay, let's tackle this. The project is about optimizing building energy efficiency using weather data and AI. First, emissions reduction. Buildings consume a lot of energy, so if the system can adjust heating, cooling, etc., based on weather, that should lower energy use and thus emissions. But how effective is it? Maybe 0.7 since it's a targeted approach but depends on adoption and building types.

Policy applicability. If the system provides data-driven insights, policymakers could use it to set standards or incentives. But how directly applicable is it? Maybe 0.6. It's useful but might need integration with existing policies, so not a direct tool but helpful.

Social benefit. Lower energy costs for residents and businesses, better comfort, and reduced strain on the grid during peak times. That's good for communities, especially low-income areas. Maybe 0.8 since it has direct benefits but might not reach everyone equally without proper implementation.

Summary: The system can significantly cut emissions by optimizing energy use, which is good for climate goals. It supports policy by offering actionable data, though broader application might need more. Social benefits include cost savings and improved living conditions, making it quite impactful.

IDEA_ID: 10_weather-dependent_energy_efficiency_optimization_s  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.75  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.65  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.8  
SUMMARY: The project directly reduces emissions by optimizing building energy use, a major source of emissions. Its policy relevance is moderate, as it could inform standards or incentives but may require integration with broader frameworks. Social benefits are high due to lower energy costs, improved comfort, and reduced grid strain, particularly for vulnerable communities.
