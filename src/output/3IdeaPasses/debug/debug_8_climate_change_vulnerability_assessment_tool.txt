Okay, let's tackle this. The project is a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Tool. The user wants me to estimate three metrics: EMISSIONS_REDUCTION, POLICY_APPLICABILITY, and SOCIAL_BENEFIT, each between 0.0 and 1.0.

First, EMISSIONS_REDUCTION. The tool is about assessing vulnerability, not directly reducing emissions. So it might not lead to direct emission cuts. However, by identifying vulnerable areas, it could guide policies that reduce emissions in the long run. But since the tool itself doesn't emit or reduce, maybe a mid-low score here. Maybe 0.4?

Next, POLICY_APPLICABILITY. This tool is for policymakers to make informed decisions. Since it combines socioeconomic, environmental, and climate data, it's directly useful for creating targeted policies. High applicability here. Maybe 0.9 or 0.85?

For SOCIAL_BENEFIT, the tool helps communities prepare and adapt to climate risks, which protects people, especially vulnerable ones. That's a significant societal benefit. So maybe high, like 0.9 as well.

Putting it together: Emissions reduction is indirect, so lower. Policy and social benefit are high. Let me check the descriptions again. The tool is AI-powered, so it's predictive and analytical. It doesn't emit, so EMISSIONS_REDUCTION is low. But the summary should explain that while it doesn't directly cut emissions, it supports policies and actions that do. Policy applicability is high because it's designed for decision-making. Social benefit is high because it protects communities. So final numbers: Emissions 0.4, Policy 0.9, Social 0.9. The summary should mention that while the tool doesn't directly reduce emissions, it supports policies that do, leading to high policy and social impact.

IDEA_ID: 8_climate_change_vulnerability_assessment_tool  
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION: 0.4  
POLICY_APPLICABILITY: 0.9  
SOCIAL_BENEFIT: 0.9  
SUMMARY: This project does not directly reduce emissions but enhances policy and community resilience by identifying vulnerabilities, enabling targeted climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Its high policy applicability stems from providing actionable insights for decision-makers, while its social benefit arises from empowering communities to prepare for climate risks, particularly protecting marginalized populations.
