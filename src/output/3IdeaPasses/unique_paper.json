    "title": "Enhancing Alaskan wildfire prediction and carbon flux estimation: A two-stage deep learning approach within a process-based model",
    "abstract": "\n Wildfires in boreal forests release substantial amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. However, current land-surface models are limited in their representation of fire processes, including their ignition and spread. This study thus developed FireDL, a novel data-driven machine-learning model for the prediction of natural wildfires, and combined it with a land-surface model to better understand the impact of fire on carbon fluxes. FireDL has a two-stage deep learning structure that sequentially combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN). Preliminary random forest analysis identified fire duration as an important factor in predicting the burned area. Thus, in FireDL, the LSTM algorithm was employed to predict fire occurrence and duration, utilizing lightning, vegetation, and climate datasets. Subsequently, the ANN predicted the total burned area using the LTSM-derived fire duration predictions and climate datasets as input. FireDL produced a robust performance in predicting large fires (>10,000 ha), achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.72. The daily-scaled burned area predictions derived from FireDL were integrated into the Community Land Model version 5 \u2013 Biogeochemistry (CLM5-BGC) to produce CLM5-BGC-FireDL. This integration considerably improved carbon emission estimations. Notably, the total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated using CLM5-BGC-FireDL in 2019, the year with the highest recorded burned area during our study, was twice that estimated using the standard CLM5-BGC. Discrepancies in the NEE can significantly influence atmospheric CO2 levels, highlighting the importance of our fire prediction model in forecasting the burned area and carbon emissions. The use of FireDL with future climate scenarios is thus anticipated to yield valuable insights into ecosystem management and climate change mitigation strategies.",

    "title": "Solar Radiation Prediction Based on the Sparrow Search Algorithm, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Networks",
    "abstract": "With the challenge of increasing global carbon emissions and climate change, the importance of solar energy as a clean energy source is becoming more pronounced. Accurate solar radiation prediction is crucial for planning and operating solar energy systems. However, the accurate measurement of solar radiation faces challenges due to the high cost of instruments, strict maintenance, and technical complexity. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning approach that integrates the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for solar radiation forecasting. The study utilizes solar radiation data from Songjiang District, Shanghai, China, from 2019 to 2020 for empirical analysis. Initially, a correlation analysis was conducted to identify the main factors affecting the intensity of solar radiation, including temperature, clear-sky GHI, solar zenith angle, and relative humidity. Subsequently, the forecasting effectiveness of the model was compared on datasets of 10 min, 30 min, and 60 min, revealing that the model performed best on the 60 min dataset, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.96221, root mean square error (RMSE) of 65.9691, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 37.9306. Moreover, comparative experimental results show that the SSA-CNN-LSTM model outperforms traditional LSTM, BiLSTM, and CNN-LSTM models in forecasting accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of SSA in parameter optimization. Thus, the SSA-CNN-LSTM model provides a new and efficient tool for solar radiation forecasting, which is of significant importance for the design and management of solar energy systems.",

    "title": "Energy system optimization based on fuzzy decision support system and unstructured data",
    "abstract": "Globally, efficient operation and optimal allocation of energy systems have become core issues in promoting sustainable development and addressing climate change. With the rapid development of economy and the continuous growth of population, the global energy demand rises sharply, while the limitation of energy resources and environmental pressure are increasingly severe. Traditional energy systems are often faced with problems such as low efficiency, unreasonable resource allocation, and serious environmental Abstract To address the complex challenges in energy systems, this study proposes a novel optimization framework that integrates fuzzy decision support and unstructured data processing technologies. This framework aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, decrease environmental impact, increase system flexibility, and enhance user satisfaction, thereby promoting sustainable development in the energy industry. The framework combines the innovative Energy Semantic Mapping Model (ESMM) and the advanced deep learning architecture ResNet to process textual and visual data effectively. ESMM enables accurate prediction of energy demand, while ResNet significantly reduces equipment maintenance costs and improves energy distribution efficiency. These advancements are critical as they address the limitations of existing approaches in handling large-scale unstructured data and making informed decisions under uncertainty. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) confirms the model\u2019s effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions. A comprehensive economic analysis demonstrates substantial cost savings in energy procurement and operations and maintenance, with overall savings exceeding 25%. Enhanced user satisfaction and reduced system response times further validate the practical utility of the proposed approach. Additionally, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the fuzzy rule base, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the model. Experimental results show superior performance compared to traditional systems, providing strong empirical evidence for the intelligent transformation of energy systems. This research contributes to the field by offering a more sophisticated and flexible solution for managing energy systems, particularly in terms of leveraging unstructured data and improving decision-making processes.",

    "title": "Risk assessment of gas plume dispersion in bunkering of alternative fuel through validated computational fluid dynamics approach",
    "abstract": "\n Maritime decarbonization is crucial in fighting climate change. Adopting low-carbon alternative fuels could help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. While liquified natural gas (LNG) has gained a strong foothold in the maritime sector over the past decades, the trend is shifting toward adopting lower and zero-carbon hydrogen and its carriers, such as methanol and ammonia, as alternative fuels. Quantifying risks from accidental leakages during storage and transfer of these alternative fuels using numerical models is required and commonly adopted in industries. The process leverages multiple models and tools for risk assessments with different accuracy levels and costs ranging from integral models to Lagrangian techniques and Eulerian approaches such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD).\n Increasingly, CFD approaches are employed for near-field dispersion analysis to assess the risk of accidental leakages. Despite their high computational cost, CFD models offer better accuracy than integral and Lagrangian models. In this work, we developed a CFD-based framework as a quantitative tool for risk assessment purposes. Our framework aims to (1) offer finer gas dispersion resolution with a detailed representation of surrounding structures and geometries, (2) minimize reliance on assumptions and empirical models to capture flow dynamics and gas dispersions accurately, and (3) mitigate conservative estimates and over-design of safety measures.\n The framework was validated using experimental data from various field tests, including a recent one involving releasing cryogenic liquids into the atmosphere. After successfully validating and comparing with experiments and other available tools, the proposed framework investigated gas plume dispersion from accidental leakages during fuel bunkering operations in ship-to-ship and shore-to-ship scenarios. The data obtained from CFD simulations was subsequently utilized to construct a surrogate model for fast prediction of gas plume behavior under varying environmental conditions. This facilitated the development of an effective emergency response plan.",

    "abstract": "The increasing frequency of active fires worldwide has caused significant impacts on terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems. Polar regions have received little attention due to their sparse populations, but active fires in the Arctic cause carbon losses from peatlands, which affects the global climate system. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the spatiotemporal variations in active fires in the Arctic and to assess the fire risk. We used MODIS C6 data from 2001 to 2019 and VIIRS V1 data from 2012 to 2019 to analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of active fires and establish a fire risk assessment model based on logistic regression. The trends in active fire frequency based on MODIS C6 and VIIRS V1 data are consistent. Throughout the Arctic, the fire frequency appears to be fluctuating and overall increasing. Fire occurrence has obvious seasonality, being concentrated in summer (June\u2013August) and highest in July, when lightning is most frequent. The frequency of active fires is related to multiple factors, such as vegetation type, NDVI, elevation, slope, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and distances from roads and settlements. A risk assessment model was constructed based on logistic regression and found to be accurate. The results are helpful in understanding the risk of fires in the Arctic under climate change and provide a scientific basis for fire prediction and control and for reducing fire-related carbon emissions.",

    "title": "Overcoming the risk of inaction from emissions uncertainty in smallholder agriculture",
    "abstract": "The potential for improving productivity and increasing the resilience of smallholder agriculture, while also contributing to climate change mitigation, has recently received considerable political attention (Beddington et al 2012). Financial support for improving smallholder agriculture could come from performance-based funding including sale of carbon credits or certified commodities, payments for ecosystem services, and nationally appropriate mitigation action (NAMA) budgets, as well as more traditional sources of development and environment finance. Monitoring the greenhouse gas fluxes associated with changes to agricultural practice is needed for performance-based mitigation funding, and efforts are underway to develop tools to quantify mitigation achieved and assess trade-offs and synergies between mitigation and other livelihood and environmental priorities (Olander 2012). High levels of small scale variability in carbon stocks and emissions in smallholder agricultural systems (Ziegler et al 2012) mean that data intensive approaches are needed for precise and unbiased mitigation monitoring. The cost of implementing such monitoring programmes is likely to be high, and this introduces the risk that projects will not be developed in areas where there is the greatest need for agricultural improvements, which are likely to correspond with areas where existing data or research infrastructure are lacking. When improvements to livelihoods and food security are expected as co-benefits of performance-based mitigation finance, the risk of inaction is borne by the rural poor as well as the global climate. In situ measurement of carbon accumulation in smallholders\u2019 soils are not usually feasible because of the costs associated with sampling in a heterogeneous landscape, although technological advances could improve the situation (Milori et al 2012). Alternatives to in situ measurement are to estimate greenhouse gas fluxes by extrapolating information from existing research to other areas with similar land uses and environmental conditions, or to combine information on land use activities with process-based models that describe expected emissions and carbon accumulation under specified conditions. Unfortunately long-term studies that have measured biomass and soil organic carbon accumulation in smallholder agriculture are scarce, and default values developed for national level emissions assessments (IPCC 2006) fail to capture local variability and may not scale linearly, so cannot be applied at the project scale without introducing considerable uncertainty and the potential for bias. If there is reliable information on the agricultural activities and environmental conditions at a project site, process-based models can provide accurate estimations of agricultural greenhouse gas fluxes that capture temporal and spatial variability (Olander 2012) but collecting the necessary data to parameterize and drive the models can be costly and time consuming. Assessing and monitoring greenhouse gas fluxes in smallholder agriculture therefore involves a balance between the resources required to collect information from thousands of smallholders across large areas, and the accuracy and precision of model predictions. Accuracy, or the absence of bias, is clearly an important consideration in the quantification of mitigation benefits for performance-based finance since a bias towards over-estimation of mitigation achieved would risk misallocating limited finance to projects that have not achieved mitigation benefits. Such a bias would also lead to a net increase in emissions if credits were used to offset emissions elsewhere. The accuracy of model predictions is related to uncertainty in model input data, which affects the precision of predictions, and errors in the model structure (Olander 2012). To limit the risk that projects receive credit for mitigation benefits that are not real, a precise-or-conservative approach to carbon accounting has emerged that requires projects to report mitigation benefits to a prescribed level of precision\u2014for example with a 90% confidence interval that is less than 20% of the estimated mitigation benefit; and if this level of precision is not reached then the lower confidence limit of the value is encouraged (VCS 2012). This helps to ensure projects that lack precision in their estimates are biased towards an underestimation of mitigation benefits, which helps limit the risk of increasing net greenhouse gas emissions. It can also mean that finance from the sale of emission reduction certificates is insufficient to support smallholder agricultural projects without donor assistance to cover the cost of project establishment (Seebauer et al 2012). Understanding the mitigation benefits of improving agricultural practice is important for many purposes other than developing carbon offsets however, and with appropriate accounting approaches risks to smallholders can be reduced and scarce resources channelled to improving land use practices. Less precision is tolerable when making payments for a broad range ecosystem services, or assessing the impacts of donor support, than it is for industrial carbon offsets. Approaches that have greater uncertainty in expected emission reductions or removals may therefore be more appropriate if there is an equal emphasis on the livelihood and environmental benefits of projects as there is on mitigation benefits. One way to balance the risk of inaction against the need for accuracy is to use process-based models in greenhouse gas accounting and decision support tools, which give users control over the precision and cost of their accounting. Such models can be parameterized and driven using readily available information or best estimates for input data, as well as site specific environmental and activity data. The potential for bias in model predictions can be limited by making use of appropriate models that are validated against regionally specific data. Although process-based models have been adopted for quantifying mitigation benefit in smallholder agriculture systems (for example Seebauer et al 2012), their use is currently limited to those with specialist knowledge or access to detailed site specific information. Web-based tools that link existing global, regional, and local environmental data with process-based models (such as RothC (Coleman and Jenkinson 1996), CENTURY (Parton et al 1987), DNDC (Li et al 1994) and DAYCENT (Del Grosso et al 2002)) that have been validated for specific areas allow users to generate initial estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural systems simply by specifying the location and intervention. This can support assessments of the feasibility of supporting these interventions through various funding sources. The same tools can also generate accurate, site specific assessments and monitoring to varying levels of detail, when required, given the inclusion of new data collected in situ . When accounting for greenhouse gases in smallholder agriculture systems users should be free to decide whether it is worthwhile to invest in collecting input data to estimate mitigation benefits with sufficient precision to meet the requirements for carbon offsets, or if greater uncertainty is tolerable. By using tools that do not require specialist support and accepting estimates of mitigation benefits that are less precise, and not necessarily conservative, those providing performance-based finance can help ensure that a greater proportion of limited budgets are spent on the activities that directly benefit smallholders and that are likely to benefit the global climate. The Small-Holder Agriculture Monitoring and Baseline Assessment methodology and prototype tool (SHAMBA 2012), which has been trialled with fifteen agroforestry and conservation agriculture projects in Malawi and is currently under review for validation under the Plan Vivo Standard (Plan Vivo 2012), provides a proof of this concept and a platform on which greater functionality and flexibility can be built. We hope that this, and other similar initiatives, will deliver approaches to greenhouse gas accounting that reduce risks and maximize benefits to smallholder farmers.

    "title": "Role of Structural Trapping in Preventing CO2 Leakage Through Faulted Caprock in Illinois Basin",
    "abstract": "\n \n Preliminary analysis of the risks associated with on-going geologic carbon storage projects has to be conducted in conditions of limited knowledge about the participating rock formations to assess the feasibility of the potential injection site. Different sources of geomechanical data (e.g., geophysical well logging and laboratory testing) are utilized to initialize numerical models for the preliminary assessment. Both data sources are associated with intrinsic limitations, increasing the uncertainty in the model prediction. In this work, one of the potential CO2 injection sites in the Illinois Basin is considered for the potential leakage through the local fault system in the vicinity of the injection well, with a special attention given to the comparison of the well-log and laboratory geomechanical data. The conducted analysis shows that while the use of geophysical well log is beneficial to make a preliminary assessment, it cannot capture complex sensitivity of material properties to state of stress, temperature, and pore fluid composition. An additional challenge during the preliminary assessment is the presence of formations which properties are unknown or highly uncertain (e.g., properties of the damage zone surrounding the small-scale fault system). It is demonstrated that the numerical model could be significantly simplified for the initial assessment, and consideration of the worst-case scenario can help to overcome the uncertainties in material properties. Preliminary risk assessment suggests that the risk of leakage through the adjacent fault system in the considered case is moderate due to the structural trapping of the injected CO2.\n \n \n \n Over the last few years, increased attention to climate change mitigation resulted in the active development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. Based on the global review of CCS status, 27 commercial facilities worldwide (with a total of 36.6 Mt of CO2 annual capacity) are operational and about 100 projects with 113 Mtpa capacity are going through different stages of construction and operation (Global CCS Institute, 2021). Even though these numbers correspond to less than 1% of the annual emission volume of CO2, which is close to 40 Gtpa (IPCC, 2022), the current stage of development is essential in establishing safe and effective approaches for further industrial-scale projects. A successful project is aimed at storing CO2 in the subsurface without risks of leakage and induced seismic response since both factors might damage the infrastructure and significantly affect the public perception of geologic carbon storage. The multistage pre-injection assessment of the risks through characterization of the involved formations and intensive monitoring program should guarantee safe operation. However, some of the essential information might not be available during the preliminary examination of risks. One of the possible approaches is to assume the worst-case scenario for the unknown or highly uncertain parameters. Low or moderate risks predicted by the simplified model based on the worst-case scenario indicate that assessment during further stages is unlikely to predict significantly higher risks.\n",

    "title": "OPTIMISED RETROFIT STRATEGIES FOR ENERGY REDUCTION AND COMFORT IN DWELLINGS FOR FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIO IN SOUTHEAST ENGLAND",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to find an optimum retrofit scheme utilising adaptation and mitigation techniques to a Sub-urban English old house, for an inevitable future climate change. It seeks its aims by investigating the energy performance, as well as the summertime comfort of old dwellings in current and future weather predictions. Studies shows that pre-1990 building stock represents one of the least energy-efficient, as these houses were built before the introduction of building envelope directives in building regulation. Specifically, uninsulated semi-detached houses of the inter-war period can potentially be an essential target for retrofits to reach the 2030 carbon emission goal. Previous researches showing the influence of warming climate on energy consumption and indoor comfort have been frequently explored in academic papers. Nevertheless, reviewed investigations were based on archetypal homes and not on a calibrated model. A sensitivity analysis examining current and future heating demand compared to building envelope main parameters was made to define two retrofit scenarios, the light retrofit scheme and the high retrofit scheme (LR and HR). Study results show that anticipated hotter temperatures have a significant effect on energy consumption and thermal comfort, especially in retrofit models using highly insulated building envelope. Warmer climate conditions can lead to a decrease in space heating and rise in cooling demand; however, heating demand remains predominant. The study also shows that the moderate retrofit scheme (LR) can achieve more than 80% of energy reduction made in the higher retrofit scheme (HR). The study reveals that overheating risk is very probable in the near future and shows that the pre-retrofitted dwelling demonstrates risks of overheating even in current weather. The occurrence of overheating in future weather data is inevitable, primarily when assessed against TM59 overheating assessment. However, overheating mitigation through adaptation strategies showed a better overheating evaluation in the light retrofit (LR) scheme compared to the high retrofit (HR) one. It is concluded that most of the energy reduction is conceived when applying the light retrofit scheme while potentially having better summertime comfort than the highly retrofitted one. The research recommends that in order to further establish a well acknowledge retrofit strategy, a greater sample size of dwellings of the same archetype is required. Further study over predicted embodied energy calculation and cost-effectiveness of the LR and HR, compared to their actual and predicted operational energy savings, can potentially materialise the idea of a light retrofit scheme.",

    "abstract": ". Introduction \nGlobal warming and its result, climate change is an important subject investigated especially in the recent decades by researchers throughout the world. In these studies, at first, climatic parameters changes are investigated. Considering many uncertainties in the parameters estimation, it is better to choose a method in order to study and analyze the uncertainty band due to different sources of uncertainty. To investigate climate change impact on different sources in the future periods, at first climatic parameters should be simulated under climate change effect. Various methods simulate the parameters, but the most valid method is application of AOGCM (Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model). A general circulation model is a three-dimension mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean and based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources (radiation, latent heat). These equations are the basis for complex computer programs commonly used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of global climate models along with sea ice and land-surface components. AOGCMs are widely applied for weather forecasting, understanding the climate, and projecting climate change. One of the most important uncertainty sources in climate change field is related to AOGCMs and emission scenarios which makes different outputs for climatic variables. \nAtmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been recorded continual increases since the 1950s, a phenomenon that may significantly alter the global and local climate characteristics, such as temperature and available water resources. IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) predicted that the world mean temperature will be increased up to 1\u00b0C by the year 2050 and up to 3\u00b0C by the end of the next century. \nEstimates of global warming are generally based on the application of general circulation models (GCMs), which attempt to predict the impact of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the weather variables. Owing to the complex mechanism in the atmosphere motion and the uncertainty of the model structure, different GCMs produce different predictions. \n2. Study Area \nIn this study, Mashhad synoptic station is chosen as the study area. The station is located in north east of Iran with 59 degrees 38 minutes of eastern longitude and 36 degrees 16 minutes of northern latitude. Its elevation is 999 meters from sea level. The situation of the region is showed in Figure 1. \n3. Material and Methods \nIn this paper, investigating the uncertainty band due to fifteen AOGCMs (including BCM2, CGMR, CNCM3, CSMK3, FGOALS, GFCM21, GIAOM, HADCM3, HADGEM, INCM3, IPCM4, MIHR, MPEH5, NCCCSM and NCPCM) under three emission scenarios including A1B, A2 and B1, changes of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall parameters in Mashhad synoptic station located in Ghareghom basin are studied. Also LARS-WG model is used for downscaling. Studying outputs of different models, it is tried that emission scenarios analysis for each parameter is done and uncertainty band due to fifteen models for emission scenarios is drawn. These band show possible changes for the studied parameters in the future period to the past one. \nAOGCMs are the most suitable tools to study climate change phenomenon, but regarding large-scale spatial resolution of these models, regional scale is not possible. In other words, the models simulate climatic parameters in large scale whereas comparing the output for historical periods with observed data shows difference. Therefore, various methods of downscaling are created. \nLARS-WG is a stochastic weather generator which can be used for the simulation of weather data at a single site under both current and future climate conditions. These data are in the form of daily time-series for a suite of climate variables, namely, precipitation (mm), maximum and minimum temperature (\u00b0C) and solar radiation (MJm-2day-1). Stochastic weather generators were originally developed for two main purposes: Firstly, providing a means of simulating synthetic weather time-series with statistical characteristics corresponding to the observed statistics at a site, but which were long enough to be used in an assessment of risk in hydrological or agricultural applications. Secondly, to provide a means of extending the simulation of weather time-series to unobserved locations, through the interpolation of the weather generator parameters obtained from running the models at neighboring sites. \nThe most recent version of LARS-WG has undergone a complete redevelopment in order to produce a robust model capable of generating synthetic weather data for a wide range of climates. LARS-WG has been compared with another widely-used stochastic weather generator, which uses the Markov chain approach at a number of sites representing diverse climates and has been shown to perform at least as well as, if not better than, WGEN at each of these sites (Semenov et al, 1998). \n4. Results and Discussion \nTo validate LARS-WG model, observation data and simulated one in the base period (1976-2005) for values of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall for each month are drawn in graphs. For each three parameters the model could have suitable accuracy that maximum differences are 0.6\u00b0c (May), 0.7\u00b0 (November) and 0.14 mm (January), respectively. Maximum and minimum uncertainty band of minimum temperature parameter are for A1B (12.5\u00b0c in year) and B1 (11.7\u00b0c in year) scenarios, respectively. These values for maximum temperature parameter are for A1B (15.7\u00b0c) and A2 (11.3\u00b0c) scenarios, and finally for rainfall parameter are for A1B (3.5 mm in year) and B1 (3.1 mm in year). Increasing minimum temperature for the future period for A1B, A2 and B1 are between (0.5-1.4\u00b0c), (0.7-1.6 \u00b0c) and (0.7-1.7\u00b0c), respectively. The values for maximum temperature parameter in the same order are (0.3-1.6\u00b0c), (0.5-1.5\u00b0c) and (0.4-1.6\u00b0c). For rainfall all the scenarios have approximately -0.1 to +0.2 mm changing values. \n5. Conclusion \nLARS-WG is able to simulate climatic parameters in the base period, since the modeled parameters and observation ones have high closeness in all months. The uncertainty due to emission scenarios for different parameters is varied. The results indicate the highest uncertainty band is related to A1B scenario, but about the lowest one various conclusions are achieved. In other words, B1 scenario for minimum temperature and rainfall parameters and A2 scenario for maximum temperature parameter are introduced. \nFinally, Estimation of long duration changes in climatic and hydrological variables concludes necessity of appropriate management of water resources considering impacts of climatic changes, especially for the regions having arid and semi-arid climate like the studied region.",
