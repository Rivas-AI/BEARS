## **Overview**  

This project aims to design energy-efficient deep learning architectures for climate applications, reducing computational carbon footprints. By leveraging lightweight neural networks and pruning techniques, the initiative optimizes model training and inference, addressing the urgent need for sustainable AI in climate modeling and energy systems.

## **Evidence Summary**  

- **Lightweight Models**: Research shows that pruning and quantization can reduce model size by 40–90% without significant accuracy loss (e.g., Han et al., 2015).  

- **Carbon Footprint Reduction**: Training a standard deep learning model emits ~10,000 kg CO₂, but optimized models can cut this by 50–70% (Strubell et al., 2019).  

- **Climate Applications**: Energy-efficient models are critical for real-time climate simulations, renewable energy forecasting, and emissions monitoring (Rasp et al., 2020).

## **Feasibility Notes**  

- **High Feasibility (0.8)**: Techniques like model pruning, knowledge distillation, and sparse training are well-established.  

- **Challenges**:  

  - Balancing model accuracy and energy efficiency for complex climate datasets.  

  - Scaling lightweight architectures to high-resolution climate simulations.  

- **Mitigation**: Use transfer learning and domain-specific optimization to maintain performance.
