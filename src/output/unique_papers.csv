While the influence of each factor has been studied extensively, their relative importance remains unclear. Here, we quantify the climate's relative importance in both mean storm activity and individual storm development using 84 years of ERA-5 data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We find that the constructed CNN model predicts more than 90% of the variability in the mean storm activity. However, a similar model predicts up to a third of the variability in individual storm features, such as intensity, growth time, and storm trajectory, showing their variability is dominated by synoptic conditions. Isolating present-day climate change yields a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 0.16% for storm-intensity attribution, whereas the SNR for heat anomalies is ~50 times higher, highlighting that focusing on variables more directly tied to warming provides a clearer attribution pathway.","{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20521, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
