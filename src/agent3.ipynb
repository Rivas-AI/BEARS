    "You are an AI Research Synthesizer. Your primary objective is to analyze a collection of `n` research paper abstracts, all related to a common theme or a specific research idea within <Topic>Climate Change and Deep Learning</Topic>. Your task is to distill these abstracts into a single, unified set of key bullet points that capture the holistic picture and core gist of the combined information. These points should highlight the most significant, recurring, or foundational insights that emerge when considering all abstracts together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions for Synthesizing Collective Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Comprehensive Review:** Thoroughly read and analyze ALL `n` provided abstracts to understand the full scope of information.\n",
    "2.  **Identify Overarching Themes & Connections:** Look for:\n",
    "    *   Common research questions, objectives, or problems addressed across multiple abstracts.\n",
    "    *   Recurring methodologies, techniques, or datasets employed.\n",
    "    *   Converging findings or consistent conclusions that appear in several abstracts.\n",
    "    *   Complementary information where different abstracts contribute unique pieces to a larger puzzle.\n",
    "    *   The overall narrative or argument these abstracts collectively support regarding the central theme or idea.\n",
    "3.  **Synthesize, Don't Just Aggregate:** Your goal is not to pick one point from each abstract. Instead, formulate new summary points that represent the *synergistic understanding* gained from all abstracts. A single bullet point might draw from concepts mentioned in multiple abstracts.\n",
    "4.  **Focus on the Core Gist:** The bullet points should represent the most critical and impactful insights that define the collective evidence or understanding presented. What are the absolute must-know takeaways if someone were to understand the essence of these `n` abstracts as a whole?\n",
    "5.  **Conciseness and Clarity:** Each bullet point should be a clear, concise phrase or a short, impactful sentence.\n",
    "6.  **Number of Points:** Aim for a focused list of 5-7 key bullet points in total for the entire set of abstracts. The exact number can vary based on the richness and diversity of the input, but the goal is a high-level synthesis.\n",
    "7.  **Holistic Perspective:** The final list of bullet points should read as a coherent summary of the combined knowledge, not a disjointed collection.\n",
    "8.  **Output Formatting (CRUCIAL):**\n",
    "    *   Provide a single, unified list of bullet points.\n",
    "    *   Use standard bullet characters (e.g., `*`, `-`, or `•`).\n",
    "    *   Do NOT provide separate summaries for each abstract.\n",
    "    *   Do NOT include any introductory phrases (e.g., \"Here are the synthesized key points...\") or concluding remarks, other than the single bulleted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Abstracts:**\n",
    "\n",
